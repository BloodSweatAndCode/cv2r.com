    <h3>The Logic</h3>
    <p>When talking about CV2 Randomizer, as well as any other randomizers, we often refer to "the logic". The logic refers the order in which items are randomized in the game such that you're never stuck in an impossible situation from which you can't progress. For example, holy water would never be in a location that requires holy water to reach it. The logic ensures that every time you generate a randomized version of the game that it is possible to complete. That doesn't mean the logic will be kind! It may make you backtrack and take on extremely hard challenges at times, but if you can endure the pain of a tough seed, there's always light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

    <h3>Items</h3>
    <p>Pretty much every item in the game is randomized. All Dracula parts, weapons, silk bag, magic cross, laurels, garlic, oak stakes, crystals, and even whip upgrades are mixed throughout the various checks in the game. Consumable items like laurels and garlic actually appear in multiple checks. The accompanying table shows each item and the number of checks it will occupy in the game.</p>
    <table class="table table-striped table-secondary">
      <thead class="thead-dark">
        <tr>
          <th style="width:24px"></th>
          <th>item</th>
          <th>count</th>
          <th>notes</ht>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <% items.forEach(function(item) { %>
        <tr>
          <td class="actor" style="background-color:#000;">
            <img src="<%= item.image %>" style="<%= item.name === 'crystals' ? 'max-height: 48px;' : '' %>">
          </td>
          <td style="width: 20%"><%= item.name %></td>
          <td style="width: 5%; text-align: center;"><%= item.count %></td>
          <td style="width: auto"><%= item.notes %></td>
        </tr>

    <h3>Checks</h3>
  	<p>The items in the randomizer can be retrieved, purchased, or battled for from the following "checks". The term "check" refers to any person, place, or thing from which you can get a randomized item. The complete list of all checks and their location can be found below.</p>
