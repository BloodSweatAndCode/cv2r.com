              <td style="width: 60%">Sath put together a fantastic tracker. It's based in EmoTracker, the same tracking software used by all other major randomizers. It allows players to have a map of the entire game, keep track of all the items you've gotten, and most importantly show you which checks you can and cannot reach with your currently obtained items. Great for rookie and veteran players alike.</td>

It details the routing and strats used to progress through the game as fast as possible. While some improvements have been made to the run over time, this IMHO is still the best place to start for the aspiring CV2 and CV2R player.</td>
